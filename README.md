2. Duplicate the Fact Table based on the identified number of Dimension Tables.
3. Create the necessary Dimension Tables.
4. Normalize the Fact Table and rename it to FactBank_Churn, then close Power Query.
5. Navigate to the modeling page by clicking the leftmost option on the home tab.
6. Establish a Snowflake model by creating relationships between the Fact Table and the Dimension Tables.
7. Use the drag-and-drop method to define these relationships.

### Explanatory Data Analysis
- Analyze the churn rate , distribution of customers according to Gender,Location,Age range,Membership
- Determine the number Customers with 2 more accounts

### Findings
- Highest number of clients are in France,Most of the banks clients have a low credit score
- Demography of the bank has more Young Adults than Midle Aged Adults

### Recommendation
1. I recommend the bank to focus more on their marketing in Spain and Germany for more client retension
2. Due to High number of Clients with Low credit , I recomend to endorse a low tier loan product to cater for the low credit score customers( minimising the banks loss)
